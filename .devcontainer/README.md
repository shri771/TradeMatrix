# Running TradeMatrix in GitHub Codespaces

This gives you **one public HTTPS link** that anyone can open — no hosting bill.
FastAPI serves the built SPA plus `/api` and `/ws` on a single port, so there is
one origin, one forwarded port, one link.

> **Codespaces is a dev environment, not a host.** The link only works while the
> codespace is *running*, and a codespace stops after a period of inactivity —
> 30 min by default, 240 min max (step 1 below). Traffic to the forwarded port does
> NOT count as activity; only interaction with the editor does. Read "Limits" at
> the bottom before relying on this.

## One-time setup

1. **Raise the idle timeout before creating anything.**
   https://github.com/settings/codespaces → *Default idle timeout* → `240` minutes.
   It is applied at creation time, so changing it later won't affect a codespace
   that already exists.

   Then **push this repo** (including `.devcontainer/`) to GitHub.

2. **Add the Databento key as a Codespaces secret** — skip if you don't need the
   futures symbols (NQ/ES/YM/GC/...); Hyperliquid crypto and yfinance stocks work
   without it.

   Repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Codespaces → New repository secret**
   - Name: `DATABENTO_API_KEY`
   - Value: the **raw key only** — no `DATABENTO_API_KEY=` prefix, no quotes, no
     trailing newline. Print exactly that from your local checkout with:

     ```bash
     sed -n 's/^DATABENTO_API_KEY=//p' .env | tr -d "\"' \t\r\n"
     ```

     Pasting the whole `NAME=value` line instead makes the in-container value
     `DATABENTO_API_KEY=db-...`, which fails auth silently: every futures fetch
     returns `[]` and the charts are simply empty.

   `.env` is gitignored, so it never reaches the codespace — the secret is how the
   key gets in. `start.sh` prefers the env var and only falls back to sourcing
   `.env` locally, so the same script covers both.

3. **Create the codespace**: green **`<> Code`** button → **Codespaces** tab →
   **Create codespace on main**.

   First boot takes ~3-5 min: it installs Python deps, runs `npm install`, and
   builds the SPA (`.devcontainer/setup.sh`), then starts the server
   (`.devcontainer/start.sh`). Watch the terminal for:

   ```
   ==> Serving TradeMatrix on :1030
   ```

4. **Make the port public** — the one manual step, and the one that makes the link
   work for other people. Port visibility cannot be set from `devcontainer.json`.

   In the codespace: **Ports** panel (next to the terminal) → right-click row
   **1030** → **Port Visibility → Public**.

   Or from your own machine:
   ```bash
   gh codespace ports visibility 1030:public -c <codespace-name>   # gh codespace list
   ```

5. **Copy the link.** In the Ports panel the "Forwarded Address" is your public URL:

   ```
   https://<codespace-name>-1030.app.github.dev
   ```

   That name is fixed when the codespace is created, so the URL stays the same
   across stop/start.

   **Test it in an incognito window, not your normal browser.** Your logged-in
   browser is authenticated to GitHub and loads the page even when the port is
   still Private — incognito is the only way to confirm step 4 actually took.

## Day-to-day

| Task | Command (in the codespace terminal) |
|---|---|
| Start the server | `bash .devcontainer/start.sh` |
| Rebuild after frontend changes | `cd frontend && npm run build` (then restart) |
| Reinstall deps | `bash .devcontainer/setup.sh` |

Frontend edits need a **rebuild** — this serves static files, not the Vite dev
server, so there is no hot reload. (That's deliberate: Vite 5.4.12+ validates the
`Host` header and rejects `*.app.github.dev` outright, so the dev server cannot
be shared this way without extra config.)

Backend edits: restart `start.sh`. Add `--reload` to the uvicorn line in
`start.sh` if you want auto-restart while developing.

## Limits — read before sharing the link

- **Stops when idle** (30 min default, 240 min max). While stopped the link just
  times out. Reopening the codespace from https://github.com/codespaces brings it
  back on the same URL — `postStartCommand` relaunches the server unattended, and
  port visibility persists, so there is nothing to redo.
- **Stop it by hand when you're not demoing** — https://github.com/codespaces →
  `...` → *Stop codespace*. This is the biggest lever on the quota below: a
  codespace left idling for 4 hours spends 8 core-hours.
- **Burns your free quota.** GitHub Free includes 120 core-hours/month; this
  config requests a 2-core machine, so ~60 wall-clock hours/month. Check
  https://github.com/settings/billing — once the quota is gone, codespaces either
  stop or start billing depending on your spending limit.
- **Deleted after 30 days** of inactivity by default, which destroys the URL.
- **A public port is genuinely public and unauthenticated.** Anyone with the link
  can call `/api/candles`, which spends *your* Databento credits. The startup
  prefetch alone fires ~27 Databento requests on every boot.
- **Org-owned repos** can forbid public port forwarding by policy; if the Public
  option is greyed out, that's why.

If you need a link that is actually always-on, this repo already builds a
single Cloud Run image (`Dockerfile` + `DEPLOY.md`) — Cloud Run's free tier
covers a low-traffic service and scales to zero. Fly.io and Hugging Face Spaces
also run this Dockerfile as-is on free tiers.
